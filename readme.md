# Jump Prediction
This repo shows another way to remove the client-sided delay from using server-sided autobhop as with [BunnyhopAPE](https://github.com/alkatrazbhop/BunnyhopAPE). While using BunnyhopAPE, it can cause client-sided prediction errors like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6Vs9R3d7zk) (your viewangle stutters if you don't fully clear the 64 unit jump), but this can prevent it ( [video is here](https://streamable.com/8p078x) ).
